Each class has a rank system from 1 to 10. For certain completed tasks you will receive special rewards. When you have completed all the ranks you will be rewarded with a special weapon for that class."

If your gear level is lower than the enemies then it will be a hard battle. But not impossible to complete. But if your gear level is higher than the enemies then it will be a lot easier to defeat the enemies. Scattered around the world are items which will increase your level. Just equip the weapon and clothes to increase your gear level."
